   GAME FORMATS
   `devices` tells you what technology a game needs:
     "none"     — fully unplugged, works with zero screens
     "shared"   — one screen at the front of the room
     "personal" — students use their own device
   Every format works with any module: the volunteer plugs in that
   module's items, scenario, or vocabulary.

    commonQuestions: [
      { q: "Is my phone a need?", a: "It depends. For an adult whose job requires it, closer to a need. For most students, it's a want that feels like a need — and noticing that difference is the skill." },

    hook: "Announce that the class has exactly $40 to get through a whole week, and start listing costs on the board until it obviously doesn't fit.",

  "save-or-spend": {
    hook: "Offer the class a deal: one small treat now, or double the treat if everyone waits until the end of the workshop. Take a vote and revisit at the end.",

      { q: "Why save if I can just ask my parents?", a: "Reframe gently toward independence and choice: saving is what lets you decide without asking anyone." },

    hook: "Ask who would like to borrow $10 from you right now. Then ask how they'd feel if you said they must pay back $12 next week.",
    miniLesson: "Credit is borrowed money you promise to pay back. Interest is the extra you pay for borrowing. Used carefully it's a tool — a car, a house, an education. Used carelessly, the extra piles up faster than people expect.",
    guidedPractice: "Walk through a 'buy now, pay later' offer as a class and work out the true total cost, not just the monthly amount.",
    checkUnderstanding: "Students explain in their own words the difference between the price of something and the true cost when borrowing.",
    extension: "Students find one real advertisement using 'pay later' language and identify what it doesn't say clearly.",

  "smart-shopping": {
    hook: "Hold up two sizes of the same snack and ask which is the better deal — then ask how they'd actually prove it.",
    miniLesson: "Price is what it costs. Value is what you get for that cost. Unit price — the cost per item, ounce, or serving — cuts straight through packaging and marketing.",
    guidedPractice: "Compare three pairs of products as a class, computing unit price for each pair before voting.",
    checkUnderstanding: "Students compute the unit price for one pair on their own and say which they'd buy and why.",

    unpluggedSwap: "Bring empty packages or printed shelf tags and run Silent Line-Up by value.",
    commonQuestions: [
      { q: "Is the bigger size always better?", a: "Only if you'll use it all. Waste turns a 'deal' into a loss — that's the nuance worth landing." },
      { q: "What if the cheap one breaks?", a: "Perfect example of value over price: durability is part of what you're buying." },
    ],
  },
  "fraud-red-flags": {
    hook: "Read a real-sounding scam text out loud with total confidence and see how many students believe it before you reveal it's fake.",
    miniLesson: "Scams almost always use the same three moves: they rush you, they ask for private information, and they want it kept secret. Spotting any one of those is your signal to stop.",
    guidedPractice: "Read scenarios aloud; students identify which of the three red flags appears in each one.",
    checkUnderstanding: "Students name all three red flags from memory and say what to do instead of clicking.",
    extension: "Students write their own fake scam message, then trade and spot each other's red flags.",

    ],
  },
  "banking-basics": {
    hook: "Ask where money goes when it's 'in the bank' — take the wildest answers seriously before explaining.",
    miniLesson: "A bank keeps your money safe and tracks it for you. Checking is for everyday spending. Savings is for money you're growing toward a goal, kept a little out of reach on purpose.",
    guidedPractice: "Sort a list of transactions into 'checking' or 'savings' as a class and discuss the close calls.",
    checkUnderstanding: "Students name one thing they'd keep in checking and one in savings, with a reason for each.",
    extension: "Students write three questions they'd ask before opening their first account.",
    unpluggedSwap: "Use the Sort It Out card game with checking and savings mats.",
    commonQuestions: [
      { q: "Is my money safe if the bank closes?", a: "Insured accounts protect deposits up to a limit — keep it reassuring and simple." },
