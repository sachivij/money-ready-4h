   GAME FORMATS
   `devices` tells you what technology a game needs:

     "shared"   — one screen at the front of the room
     "personal" — students use their own device
   Every format works with any module: the volunteer plugs in that
   module's items, scenario, or vocabulary.

    miniLesson: "Needs keep you alive, safe, and healthy: food, water, a place to live, clothes for the weather. Wants make life more fun. The tricky part is that the same object can be either one depending on who you are and what your life looks like.",
    guidedPractice: "As a class, sort ten everyday items into needs and wants. Every time someone disagrees, stop and ask what situation would make it a need.",
    checkUnderstanding: "Each student names one need and one want out loud, and explains one item that could be both.",

    commonQuestions: [

    guidedPractice: "Build a paycheck together on the board, removing one deduction at a time and naming what each one funds.",
    checkUnderstanding: "Given an hourly wage and hours worked, students estimate gross pay and a rough take-home figure.",
    extension: "Students list three things in their community that taxes help pay for.",
    unpluggedSwap: "Use paper paycheck-builder sheets and Two Truths and a Myth about taxes.",
    commonQuestions: [
      { q: "Can I get that money back?", a: "Some may come back as a tax refund, but plan around net pay rather than counting on it." },

  "smart-shopping": {
    hook: "Hold up two sizes of the same snack and ask which is the better deal — then ask how they'd actually prove it.",
    miniLesson: "Price is what it costs. Value is what you get for that cost. Unit price — the cost per item, ounce, or serving — cuts straight through packaging and marketing.",

    unpluggedSwap: "Bring empty packages or printed shelf tags and run Silent Line-Up by value.",
    commonQuestions: [

  "fraud-red-flags": {
    hook: "Read a real-sounding scam text out loud with total confidence and see how many students believe it before you reveal it's fake.",
    miniLesson: "Scams almost always use the same three moves: they rush you, they ask for private information, and they want it kept secret. Spotting any one of those is your signal to stop.",
    guidedPractice: "Read scenarios aloud; students identify which of the three red flags appears in each one.",

  "banking-basics": {
    hook: "Ask where money goes when it's 'in the bank' — take the wildest answers seriously before explaining.",

  },
  "college-cost-choices": {
    hook: "Put two schools on the board with wildly different price tags and the same career at the end, and ask which they'd choose before knowing anything else.",
    miniLesson: "The same goal can cost very different amounts. Scholarships, grants, community college, and in-state options all change the math. Loans are real money you repay later with interest, and they shape choices for years.",
    guidedPractice: "Compare two realistic paths side by side, adding up four years of cost and what would be owed at the end.",
    checkUnderstanding: "Students name two ways to lower the cost of education after high school.",
    extension: "Students look up one scholarship they'd actually be eligible for.",
    unpluggedSwap: "Use printed path-comparison sheets and Would-You-Rather between two funding choices.",
    commonQuestions: [
      { q: "Is an expensive school always better?", a: "No. Fit, program, and cost matter more than price. Push back gently on prestige as the deciding factor." },
      { q: "Is college the only option?", a: "Absolutely not — trades, certifications, apprenticeships, and military paths are all legitimate. Say so plainly." },
    ],
  },
  "investing-mythbusters": {
    hook: "Ask who thinks investing is basically gambling. Take the temperature of the room honestly before correcting anything.",
    miniLesson: "Investing puts money to work over time. Risk and return travel together. Compound growth means your earnings start earning too — which is why starting early often beats investing more later.",
    guidedPractice: "Compare two savers on the board: one who starts early and stops, one who starts later and continues. Work out who ends up ahead.",
    checkUnderstanding: "Students explain compound growth in one sentence, in their own words.",
    extension: "Students explain compound growth to someone at home and report back what that person said.",
    unpluggedSwap: "Run Two Truths and a Myth with investing myths, and do the compounding math on the board.",
    commonQuestions: [
      { q: "Can I lose everything?", a: "Any single investment can lose value, which is why spreading money out matters. Keep it honest without being scary." },
      { q: "Do I need a lot of money to start?", a: "No — the myth that it's only for rich adults is exactly what this module busts." },
